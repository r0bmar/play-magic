# play-magic
A game of my creation similar to jawbreaker or Candy Crush, written in Java.
You have 30 moves to record as high a score as you possibly can.
You click to remove tiles, all adjacent tiles of the same color will be removed (except on diagonals).
There is the option of reshuffling once per game using the r key.
There is a special tile called the "bomb" which removes diagonals as well as other adjacent tiles (regardless of color).
New features may come in the future.

Happy playing!
